Highly efficient implementation of [introsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort) (introspective sort) algorithm, hybrid of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort that has particularly good runtime behavior.  It is one of the fastest comparison sorting, algorithms in use today, and is the usual implementation of the std::sort algorithm provided with the C++ STL.
